        <p>My name is Sandy Smith, and I currently live in Maryville, TN, with my husband, son, and two four-legged children. <br>
        <br>
        Spending time with my family is defined as time well spent. I have a special needs son, that lives at home, and another son that lives in a nearby town.  Of course, as their Mom, I am proud of both of my sons.  We have a team of nurses and care-givers that assist us with our special needs son.  He has quite a personality that is sweet, and humorous.  As my other son lives on his own, he often stops by to visit.  I am rather suspicious that it is more like checking up on us.<br>
        <br>
        2019 was a tough year of losses dear to me.  I lost three dogs that I raised from puppies. Our dogs were Labrador Retreiver, English Springer Spaniel, and a Boxer.  Our Labrador Retreiver passed away in January, at 18 years old. Our English Springer Spaniel was diagnosed in May with a potential cancer that required emergency surgery, 3 months later, he passed away.  Our Boxer, was actually my eldest Son's dog.  We fostered him while my son was in the Army.  Needless to say, my son's dog became my dog.  He had cancer tumors, and underwent 3 surgeries.  He was only supposed to live for 3 months in his second year, but died last year.  This was a wonderful 6 years, in total, with this dog.  Because of his cancer, he went everywhere that I could take him and we became very attached to me. I fell in love with the breed of boxers. <br>
        <br>
        So here it is 2020, and I am not sure how this happened, but we have two new dogs.  Both were rescued, and yes, one of them is a gorgeous Boxer, who is about to eat me out of my home! It is my first time with rescues, so I have had to let them find their place in our family. <br>
        <br>
        So when I am not doting my son or my pets, I am either doing any of the following: <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Cooking</li>
            <li>Gardening</li>
            <li>Watching a good mystery!</li>
            <li>Painting</li>
            <li>Traveling, only as my bank account can afford it, but mostly Hawaii.</li>
            <li>Photographing</li>
        </ul>
        I love to photograph, but I am a bit of a perfectionist about it, so its not so easy to just pick up a camera and photograph anything.  I used to photograph professionally, and compete in print competitions.  I won local competitions, and also, some international print competition.  My specialty was Wedding Photogaphy.  I always come "alive" behind a camera, as I have done it since 1993. Yes, you guessed it, I started with it was strictly film!  You would be surprised to know that if you really understand lighting, it is all about mathematics!</p>
        <br>
        And finally, as I am from Hawaii, I still have family there.  I try to visit Hawaii every other year to see my family. Besides seeing my family, the trip is mostly about the food and beaches!
